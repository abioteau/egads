<h1>The "Tiny" random number infrastructure</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Tiny is divided into two parts, the Entropy Gateway (EG) and the
Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG).  The PRNG is a slight
modification of the PRNG used in Yarrow-160 (we use a MAC instead of a
block cipher in counter mode, and make other minor changes).  The
entropy gateway is totally different than anything specified in the
Yarrow paper, and is also completely different from the Yarrow-AES
algorithm John and Pravir worked on while at Cigital (potential IP
issues was one reason for this new algorithm; efficiency was the
other).

<h3>Components of the Entropy Gateway</h3>

<ol>
 <li> The "entropy pool".  The entropy pool is a collection unit for raw
      data coming in from entropy sources.  The pool consists of a buffer
      (the entropy buffer), a 128-bit counter, and an array of N entropy
      estimates.  The entropy buffer is implemented as a set of parallel
      LSFRs (linear shift feedback registers).
 </li>
 <li> The "slow pool".  The slow pool is a set of data structures
      intended to provide cryptographic security as a fallback mechanism, in
      case entropy sources are compromised.  The slow pool consists of a
      UMAC context, and a buffer of size KEYSZ (we call this the pre-key,
      as it will ultimately replace the internal UMAC key).
 </li>
 <li> An output buffer.  This is a buffer that contains "processed"
      entropy.  External requests for entropy get serviced from this buffer. 
 </li>
</ol>

<h3>The Entropy Pool</h3>
<p>
The counter and entropy estimates initialize to zeros.  The entropy
buffer initializes to all bits set (each byte is 0xff).  When the
entropy pool is flushed (see below), all elements of the entropy pool
get set to the original state, except for the counter.
</p>
<p>
The entropy buffer is really 8 parallel LSFRs.  Entropy sources mix
their data into this pool.  Bytes get mixed in using a primitive
polynomial of the appropriate size over GF(2).  We use polynomials
taken from /dev/random, though the mixing code is different.
</p>
<p>
Here are primitive polynomials taken from /dev/random.  Hopefully they
are not too sparse:
</p>

<ul>
 <li>2048 bytes: x^2048 + x^1638 + x^1231 + x^819 + x^411 + x + 1</li>
 <li>1024 bytes: x^1024 + x^817 + x^615 + x^412 + x^204 + x + 1</li>
 <li>512 bytes:  x^512 + x^411 + x^308 + x^208 + x^104 + x + 1</li>
</ul>
<p>
Special note: The buffer size must be at least eight times (default is
16) the size of the output size (UOL), to avoid entropy loss when
sources only provide entropy in lower order bits.  (Optionally, we can
do some sort of shifting, but it seems like more effort than it is
worth).  This is sufficient for Tiny, because we never expect the
entire buffer to contain more than UOL bits of entropy.
</p>
<p>
The 2nd-6th terms of the polynomial are "taps", numbered 1 through 5.
To mix in a byte of entropy, we take the byte, xor it with the 5 taps,
then we rotate the pool left one byte, and replace the first byte of
the pool with the result.
</p>
<p>
When entropy comes in from a source, the entropy counter for that
source is incremented by the "hint" provided by the source (note that
there is no need to count past THRESH for any one source, and doing so
might result in overflow errors).
</p>
<p>
After entropy is added, the EG checks to see if the LSFR has enough
entropy to output.  The output rule is as follows:
</p>
<p>
Total the entropy collected from all sources, after subtracting out
the top R contributors.  If the number of bits is > THRESH, then an
output occurs.
</p>
<p>
Outputs can go to the output buffer or to the slow pool.  The rules for
where to output are as follows:
</p>
<ol>
 <li> If the slow pool has not reseeded (ie, the internal UMAC context has
      not been initialized), outputs go to the slow pool.
 </li>
 <li> If the output buffer is full, outputs go to the slow pool.
 </li>
 <li>The first (Q-P) out of every Q outputs go to the output buffer.
     The remaining P go to the slow pool.  If any outputs went to the 
     slow pool because the output buffer was filled, then any counters 
     get reset.  That is, the next Q-P outputs should go to the output
     buffer, if possible.
 </li>
</ol>
To output to either buffer:
<ol>
 <li> Increment the UMAC nonce by one.  </li>
 <li> UMAC the contents of the entropy buffer.</li>
</ol>

If outputing to the output buffer:
<ol>
 <li> Place the results in the output buffer.</li>
 <li>Re-initialize the entropy buffer (to 0xff) and the entropy estimates.</li>
</ol>

To output to the slow pool:
<ol>
 <li>XOR the output into the first UOL bytes of the slow buffer.</li>
 <li>Rotate the slow buffer left UOL bytes.</li>
 <li>Re-initialize the entropy buffer (to 0xff) and the entropy estimates.</li>
 <li>Re-seed the slow pool, if necessary.</li>
</ol>

<h3>The Slow Pool</h3>
<p>
At startup, the slow pool counter is set to zero.  The step is set to
zero.  The UMAC is initialized with a key of all zeros, and a nonce of
the current time as reported by gettimeofday(), truncating off the
most significant bits if necessary.  The buffer is initialized to all
zeros.
</p>

<h3>Slow Pool Reseeds</h3>
<p>
When the entropy pool has output to every byte of the pre-key once and
only once, that is called a "pass" on the pre-key.
</p>
<p>
If the slow pool has never reseeded before, it reseeds after a single
pass on the pre-key.
</p>
<p>
Otherwise, the slow pool takes twice as many passes on the pre-key to
reseed as it did the last time it reseeded, with a maximum of 32.
</p>
<p>
When the slow pool reseeds, output KEYLEN blocks of output as follows: 
</p>
<ol>
 <li>Increment the nonce by one.</li>
 <li>UMAC UOL bytes of the pre-key.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Then, take the resulting bytes, and overwrite the UMAC key.  
Finally, zero out the pre-key.
</p>

<h3>The Output Buffer</h3>
<p>
Outputs are serviced from the output buffer.  Outputs should be given in
byte-quantities.  Pending requests that cannot be fufilled should be
queued until output is available.  If multiple requests are pending,
they should be served in round-robin style.
</p>

<h3>Saving and restoring state</h3>
<p>
The Tiny EG should be able to save and restore its state.  The UMAC
context only should be stored.  On restore, the requirement for
entropy pool outputs to go to the slow pool is ignored.  The slow pool
reseeds after a single pass on the pre-key.
</p>

<h3>EG Rationalle</h3>
<p>
The EG tries to output pure entropy.  We try to collect at least as
many bits of entropy as we wish to output, and usually collect more,
because of a conservative assumption that an attacker might be able to
compromise one or more entropy sources.  If sufficient entropy exists,
the EG should produce "good" outputs.  We mearly compress (lossily)
and whiten the entropy pool using UMAC.
</p>
<p>
When sufficient entropy is not available due to compromise, UMAC
provides cryptographic security as a fallback, assuming that the
system has ever mixed sufficient entropy into the slow pool.  
</p>
<p>
We clear the entropy pool every time to ensure that there are no
correlations between successive outputs.
</p>
<p>
We use UMAC because it is fast and has good provable properties.  The
only assumption we need to make (assuming our design doesn't suck) is
the cryptographic strength of AES.
</p>

<h2>The Tiny PRNG</h2>
<p>
Tiny uses the original Yarrow-160 PRNG, except that:
</p>
<ol>
<li>We use UMAC instead of a block cipher. The nonce is the counter.</li>
<li>We need data to mac... that is a 128-bit value, passed in as part of the 
    seed.</li>
<p>
The generator gate frequency is a system parameter (for
self-rekeying).  The default frequency is every 10 outputs, as in
Yarrow-160.  The self-rekey operation is about the same as in
Yarrow. The key is overwritten with blocks of generator output, along
with the counter and the counter step.  The step parameter is always
modified to be odd after a rekey.
</p>
<p>
The seed should be raw entropy, and big enough to set the counter, the
UMAC key and the step parameter.  If the step parameter is not odd, it
is modified to be so.
</p>
<p>
"Real" reseeds (ones where we add new entropy to the PRNG) can happen
by periodic polling, or by push.  In both cases, there should be a
parameter, minimum time between reseeds.  We recommend 60 seconds as
the default parameter.
